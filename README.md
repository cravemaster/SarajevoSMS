# SMS bomber by Sarajevo
An (a concept of an?) SMS bomber/spammer,
based literally off the Bosnian War from 1992-1995
and Sarajevo Christmas Eve 12/24 used to make a jailbreak
. DOES NOT function at all, just a prototype:
I'm actually waiting for other developers to contribute to this project.
Supposedly only to work on jailbroken iOS devices.
Icon from Dead Winter Dead album.
